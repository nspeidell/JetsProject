# JetsProject

# Overview
The Jets Application begins by using a text file to create a list of jets.  Once the list is populated a menu is presented to the user with 9 options.
The user can display the entire list, fly all the jets and display their flight time, view the fastest jet or the longest range, they can also request unique actions
for jets that have the ability to load cargo and dog fight.  A user ccan also add or remove a jet form the list at anytime.  Finally the user cna quit the program.

# Lessons Learned
I seem to be having  tough time with building lists, arrays, etc... Last week my biggest struggle was to build a food truck
and the same thing this week.  I struggled to add jets to the list once I input them.  Secondly i had not understood 
interfaces at all, so I had to read the whole chapter to figure out how they worked.  The menu wasn't too hard because I
already paid my dues with the food truck.
